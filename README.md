#Junior-

Hello. Currently this is a project in the works.

Junior- is a dialect of Lisp. I am making this project to understand
more of the C language, learn how to program my own language, and learn more
about functional languages.

This project is made possible through [Daniel Holden (orangeduck)](https://github.com/orangeduck)
for both writing the book [Build Your Own Lisp](http://buildyourownlisp.com/)
as well as providing the MPC library which makes it very to easy to do very
cool things in C.
